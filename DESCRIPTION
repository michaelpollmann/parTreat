Description: Efficiently estimate treatment effects imposing a parametric assumption on treatment effects of the form Y(1) = h(Y(0),theta).
    Currently two estimators for the additive model Y(1) = Y(0) + theta are implemented, as well as a helper function to use them to estimate treatment effects based on a multiplicative model.
